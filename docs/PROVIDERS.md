# OpenMontage Provider Guide

Everything you need to know about every provider in OpenMontage — setup instructions, pricing, free tiers, and what each unlocks.

---

## Quick Start: What Should I Set Up?

**Start free, add paid providers as you need them.** Here's the recommended order:

| Step | Cost | What to set up | What it unlocks |
|------|------|----------------|-----------------|
| 0 | **already paid for** | Jimeng (即梦) membership + Gemini subscription + Suno subscription | Seedance 2.0 video, Gemini images, and Suno music with **no API key** — see [No-API-Key Providers](#no-api-key-providers-use-your-own-subscriptions) |
| 1 | **$0** | Pexels + Pixabay | Stock photos and videos — enough to produce basic videos |
| 2 | **$0** | Google API key | TTS with 700+ voices (1M chars/month free) + $300 new account credit |
| 3 | **$0** | ElevenLabs | Premium TTS + music + SFX (10K chars/month free) |
| 4 | **$0** | Piper (local install) | Fully offline TTS — no API key, no cost, no network |
| 5 | **~$0.03/image** | fal.ai | FLUX images + Kling/Veo/MiniMax video + Recraft — broad single-key image + video coverage |

#   gemini_web_image   python -m tools._browser login gemini (Gemini subscription quota)
```

---

## No-API-Key Providers (use your own subscriptions)

These three spend an account you already pay for instead of an API key. Both report `runtime: browser` in the registry and `estimate_cost() == 0.0` USD — the real budget is your subscription quota or credit balance, so treat cost governance as "credits/quota", not dollars.

### Jimeng (即梦) — Seedance 2.0 video on membership credits

> **Best if you have a Jimeng membership but no Volcengine or fal.ai key.** Runs the official `dreamina` CLI, which authenticates with your own account via OAuth device flow.

**Tool unlocked:** `dreamina_video`
**Env vars:** none — the CLI stores its own session in `~/.dreamina_cli`

#### Setup

```bash
dreamina login          # OAuth device flow — opens a verification URL + code
dreamina user_credit    # confirm: {"total_credit": ..., "vip_level": ...}
```

Install the `dreamina` CLI first if it isn't on PATH. For a headless machine: `dreamina login --headless`, then `dreamina login checklogin --device_code=<code>`.

#### What it's best for

- Seedance 2.0 video with native synced audio, no API key
- 全能参考 (multimodal) mode: up to 9 image + 3 video + 3 audio references in one shot
- First/last-frame and 2–20 keyframe continuity between shots
- Character consistency driven by reference images
- Chinese-language prompts

#### Modes and limits

| `operation` | CLI command | Ratio from | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| `text_to_video` | `text2video` | `--ratio` | 4–15 s |
| `image_to_video` | `image2video` | input image | 4–15 s (3.x models: 3–12 s) |
| `frames_to_video` | `frames2video` | first frame | 4–15 s |
| `multiframe_to_video` | `multiframe2video` | first image | 0.5–8 s per segment, ≥2 s total |
| `multimodal_to_video` / `reference_to_video` | `multimodal2video` | `--ratio` | 4–15 s |

Seedance 2.0 family is 720p-only; 1080p requires `3.5pro`/`3.0pro` on the image/frames modes. `multiframe_to_video` accepts no model or resolution override.

#### Pricing

Billed in **membership credits**, not USD. Observed: a 6 s `seedance2.0fast` 720p clip cost **66 credits** (~11 credits/second). Check the balance with `dreamina user_credit`; each result reports actual spend in `data.credit_count`.

#### Notes

`AigcComplianceConfirmationRequired` is terminal — run that model once manually in the Jimeng web UI to accept the confirmation, then retry. Re-downloading a finished task is free; regenerating is not. See `.agents/skills/dreamina-cli/SKILL.md` for the full retry discipline.

---

### Gemini Web — images on your Gemini subscription

> **Best if you have Gemini Pro / Google One AI but no `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.** Drives gemini.google.com through a persistent Chromium profile that holds your login.

**Tool unlocked:** `gemini_web_image`
**Env vars:** none required (`OPENMONTAGE_BROWSER_*` are optional tuning)

#### Setup

```bash
pip install playwright
python -m playwright install chromium
python -m tools._browser login gemini    # sign in yourself in the window that opens
python -m tools._browser status          # confirm
```

OpenMontage never reads, types, or stores your credentials — you sign in by hand. Cookies live in `~/.openmontage/browser/gemini`, outside the repo. `python -m tools._browser logout gemini` forgets the session.

#### What it's best for

- Character and scene reference sheets kept consistent across a shoot
- Keyframes feeding a video model (first/last frame, multi-keyframe modes)
- Conversational edits of an image you already generated
- Any still where you'd rather spend subscription quota than per-image API cost

#### Watermark cleanup (important)

Gemini stamps a small sparkle glyph in the bottom-right corner (measured: 15×12px, 31px from the right edge, 42px from the bottom on a 1024×572 output). Used as a video reference frame, it gets reproduced into the footage where it can't be fixed.

Removal is on by default and `watermark_mode: "auto"` picks the best remover installed — `fsr` (frequency-selective reconstruction, needs `opencv-contrib-python`) rebuilds the surrounding texture through the patch and is invisible at 100%; `lama` (needs `simple-lama-inpainting`) is comparable; `telea` leaves a flat blob on texture; `delogo` (ffmpeg) is a visible smudge; `crop` cuts the strip off. For best results:

```bash
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```

Verify `data.watermark_cleanup.applied` and read `quality` before using the image downstream.

#### File format

Gemini serves JPEG regardless of the extension you request. The tool re-encodes to match your `output_path` and reports both `format` (on disk) and `source_format` (as served).

#### Limits

No seed, no negative prompt, no ratio control — the requested aspect ratio is written into the prompt as a request, not a constraint. One request at a time per profile (a Chromium profile can't be opened twice), so parallel scene generation serializes here. A web session can require re-login mid-batch, which makes this a poor fit for unattended runs.

Failures dump a screenshot and page HTML to `~/.openmontage/browser/_debug/gemini/`. When the web UI changes, selectors are data — override them in `~/.openmontage/browser/selectors.json` without touching code. See `.agents/skills/gemini-web-image/SKILL.md`.

---

### Suno Web — music on your Suno subscription

> **Best if you have a Suno subscription but no music API key.** Drives suno.com/create through a persistent Chromium profile that holds your login. Suno has no self-serve public API, so the web app is the only way to spend a Suno subscription programmatically.

**Tool unlocked:** `suno_web_music`
**Env vars:** none required (`OPENMONTAGE_BROWSER_*` are optional tuning)

Not to be confused with `suno_music`, a separate tool that calls the third-party reseller `sunoapi.org` and needs `SUNO_API_KEY`. Different provider, different billing.

#### Setup

```bash
pip install playwright
python -m playwright install chromium
python -m tools._browser login suno      # sign in yourself in the window that opens
python -m tools._browser status          # confirm
```

Credentials are never read, typed, or stored by OpenMontage. Cookies live in `~/.openmontage/browser/suno`, outside the repo.

#### What it's best for

- Instrumental beds for narrated video, where vocals would fight the voiceover
- Mood-specific BGM described in plain language (genre + instrumentation + tempo)
- Any track where you'd rather spend subscription credits than per-track API cost

#### Prompting

Write a style sentence, not a story: genre + mood + instrumentation + tempo. English works better than Chinese, and under ~200 characters stays sharp.

```
Cinematic tension underscore, dark strings and pulsing sub-bass,
building dread with a single low piano motif, instrumental, 80 BPM
```

Keep `instrumental: true` for anything under narration. The tool flips the Instrumental switch *and* writes "instrumental, no vocals" into the prompt, because the switch is the most drift-prone selector. Check `data.instrumental_toggle_applied` — `false` means only the wording asked, so listen before trusting it.

#### Duration and candidates

`supports.exact_duration` is `false` — Suno picks the length. Generate for **mood**, read `data.duration_seconds`, then trim with ffmpeg in the edit stage. Asking for "a 45-second track" will not produce one.

One generation renders two candidates for one credit spend. `download_all: true` saves both as `<name>.1.mp3` / `<name>.2.mp3` — auditioning two files you already paid for is free, regenerating is not.

#### Limits

No seed, no stems, no exact duration. One request at a time per profile (a Chromium profile can't be opened twice). Generation takes 1-3 minutes. `retry_policy.max_retries = 0` on purpose: regeneration spends credits, so the agent decides, never the tool. A reported credit exhaustion is terminal — fall back to `pixabay_music` (free) or `google_music` (paid, bills GCP) rather than retrying.

The `suno` selector table was written from Suno's documented UI, not verified against a live signed-in DOM, so expect to repair one or two selectors on the first real run. Failures dump a screenshot and page HTML to `~/.openmontage/browser/_debug/suno/`; override selectors in `~/.openmontage/browser/selectors.json` without touching code. See `.agents/skills/suno-web-music/SKILL.md`.

## Cloud Providers

### xAI — Grok Image + Video

> **Best if you want one provider for image edits and reference-conditioned short video.** Grok covers both image generation/editing and video generation under one key.

**Tools unlocked:** `grok_image`, `grok_video`
**Env var:** `XAI_API_KEY`

#### Setup

1. Create an xAI developer account
2. Generate an API key in the xAI developer console
3. Add to `.env`: `XAI_API_KEY=xai-...`

#### What it's best for

- Image editing and style transfer
- Multi-image composites into one generated frame
- Short reference-image videos where a person, garment, or product must carry into motion

#### Pricing

Current xAI docs pricing for the Grok media models:

| Model | Price |
|------|-------|
| `grok-imagine-image` | $0.02 per generated image |
| `grok-imagine-image` input images (edits/composites) | $0.002 per input image |
| `grok-imagine-video` at 480p | $0.05/sec |
| `grok-imagine-video` at 720p | $0.07/sec |
| `grok-imagine-video` input images | $0.002 per input image |

OpenMontage now uses those published rates in the Grok tool estimators.

### Volcengine Jimeng — 即梦 AI Video Generation

> **Direct ByteDance API via V4 signing.** Calls the Volcengine visual API (visual.volcengineapi.com) with HMAC-SHA256 request signing using IAM AK/SK credentials. Supports text-to-video and image-to-video via Jimeng 3.0 Pro.

**Tools unlocked:** `jimeng_video`
**Env vars:** `VOLC_ACCESSKEY` (Access Key ID) + `VOLC_SECRETKEY` (Secret Access Key)

#### Setup

1. Go to [console.volcengine.com/iam/keymanage](https://console.volcengine.com/iam/keymanage)
2. Create a Volcengine account if you don't have one
3. Create an Access Key pair (AK + SK)
4. Ensure your account has access to Jimeng AI (即梦) video generation service
5. Add to `.env`: `VOLC_ACCESSKEY=...` and `VOLC_SECRETKEY=...`

#### What it's best for

- Direct ByteDance/Volcengine API quota usage
- Jimeng 3.0 Pro text-to-video and image-to-video
- Chinese-language prompt understanding
- Configurable frame count (121=5s, 241=10s) and aspect ratio

#### API notes

Authentication uses Volcengine IAM V4 signing (HMAC-SHA256), not a Bearer token. The signing process builds a canonical request, derives a signing key from SK → date → region → service, and signs the request.

API flow: `POST ?Action=CVSync2AsyncSubmitTask` → poll `POST ?Action=CVSync2AsyncGetResult` → download `video_url`.

The implementation uses the compatible generic `CVSync2Async*` route (API version `2022-08-31`) rather than the model-specific `2024-06-06` actions presented in the public API explorer. This is intentional — the generic route supports the same Jimeng 3.0 Pro model via `req_key` while remaining stable across model updates.

The `req_key` for video is `jimeng_ti2v_v30_pro`. Success code is `10000`. Task statuses: `in_queue`, `generating`, `done`, `not_found`, `expired`.

**Authoritative API reference:** [Jimeng TI2V V30 Pro SubmitTask](https://api.volcengine.com/api-docs/view?action=JimengTI2VV30PROSubmitTask&serviceCode=cv&version=2024-06-06)

**Schema constraints** (enforced by `input_schema` to prevent paid-call failures):
- `prompt`: max 800 characters
- `frames`: must be exactly `121` (5s) or `241` (10s) at 24fps
- `seed`: `-1` for random, or any non-negative integer

#### Pricing

| Model | Price |
|------|-------|
| Jimeng 3.0 Pro (video) | ~$0.05/sec (check Volcengine console for actual rate) |

---

### Alibaba DashScope — Qwen Image + TTS + ASR

> **Best for Chinese-language production.** One key unlocks Qwen-Image generation, Qwen-TTS Mandarin narration, and Qwen-ASR with word-level timestamps — the only DashScope path that provides word-level granularity for subtitle alignment.

**Tools unlocked:** `dashscope_image`, `dashscope_tts`, `dashscope_asr`
**Env var:** `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`

#### Setup

1. Go to [dashscope.aliyun.com](https://dashscope.aliyun.com/)
2. Create an Alibaba Cloud account if you don't have one
3. Generate an API key in the DashScope console
4. Add to `.env`: `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-...`

#### What it's best for

- Chinese-language image generation with strong prompt understanding (Qwen-Image)
- Natural Mandarin narration (Qwen-TTS, Cherry voice)
- Word-level timestamp transcription for subtitle alignment (Qwen-ASR filetrans)
- Replacing the broken `whisperx` slot for ASR

#### API notes

DashScope's `/compatible-mode/v1/` only supports `/chat/completions` and `/embeddings`. Image gen, TTS, and ASR all use DashScope-native endpoints with nested `{model, input, parameters}` request shape — not OpenAI-compatible paths.

The ASR tool (`qwen3-asr-flash-filetrans`) uses an async submit-poll pattern. Audio must be at a publicly accessible URL (local files are not supported). Word timestamps are in milliseconds, normalized to seconds by the tool.

#### Pricing

| Model | Price |
|------|-------|
| `qwen-image-2.0-pro` | ~$0.02 per image (check console for current rates) |
| `qwen3-tts-flash` | ~$0.000015 per character |
| `qwen3-asr-flash-filetrans` | Per-minute billing (check console) |

---

### fal.ai — Multi-Model Gateway

> **Broad single-key coverage.** One API key unlocks image and video providers across multiple models.

**Tools unlocked:** `flux_image`, `recraft_image`, `kling_video`, `veo_video`, `minimax_video`
**Env var:** `FAL_KEY`

#### Setup

1. Go to [fal.ai](https://fal.ai/) and click **Sign up** (GitHub or Google)
2. Navigate to [fal.ai/dashboard/keys](https://fal.ai/dashboard/keys)
3. Click **Create Key**, copy it
4. Add to `.env`: `FAL_KEY=your-key-here`

#### Pricing

No subscription — pure pay-as-you-go, no minimum spend.

**Image generation:**

| Model | Price | Per $1 |
|-------|-------|--------|
| FLUX Pro v1.1 | $0.05/image | 20 images |
| FLUX Dev | $0.03/image | 33 images |
| Recraft v3 | ~$0.04/image | 25 images |

**Video generation:**

| Model | Price | Per $1 |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Kling 2.5 Turbo Pro | $0.07/sec | 14 seconds |
| MiniMax | ~$0.05/sec | 20 seconds |
| Veo 3 | $0.40/sec | 2.5 seconds |
| WAN 2.5 | $0.05/sec | 20 seconds |

**Free tier:** None — but $0 to start, you only pay for what you use.

---

### Kling Official — Direct API

> **Official Kling path.** This is separate from `kling_video` via fal.ai: it uses Kling's official `Authorization: Bearer <KLING_API_KEY>` API, provider name `kling_official`, and direct Classic/Turbo/Omni task protocols.

**Tools unlocked:** `kling_official_video`, `kling_official_image`, `kling_tts`, `kling_avatar`, `kling_lip_sync`
**Env vars:** `KLING_API_KEY`, optional `KLING_API_BASE_URL`

#### Setup

1. Create or open a Kling AI Open Platform account.
2. Generate an official API key in the Kling API console.
3. Add to `.env`:
   ```bash
   KLING_API_KEY=your-key-here
   # Optional, defaults to Singapore:
   KLING_API_BASE_URL=https://api-singapore.klingai.com
   ```

#### What It Is Best For

- Direct official Kling API provenance rather than fal.ai gateway routing
- Text-to-video, image-to-video, and deep Video Omni reference workflows via `kling_official_video`
- Text-to-image, image edit/reference, and Image Omni multi-reference or series workflows via `kling_official_image`
- Text-to-speech via `kling_tts` when you already know the official Kling `voice_id`
- Cloud avatar presenter clips via `kling_avatar`, without replacing local `talking_head`
- Cloud lip-sync via `kling_lip_sync`, with explicit face selection for multi-person videos
- Accounts that need to use official Kling model permissions, resource packs, or regional endpoints

#### Notes

- `provider="kling_official"` is intentionally different from fal.ai's `provider="kling"`.
- Official Kling is a paid remote API. OpenMontage uses conservative cost estimates and includes high-cost factors such as Omni references, series output, 4k mode, and native sound.
- Local image paths are sent as raw base64 for supported Classic/image-generation fields. Turbo image-to-video requires a URL and will not silently upload through fal.ai.
- Video Omni and Image Omni can pass official `element_id` references through `element_list`; Elements remain an internal Kling Official helper, not a standalone OpenMontage capability.
- Account Usage is available as a low-frequency diagnostic helper under `tools/_kling/account.py`; it is not a selector or pipeline tool.
- `callback_url` is passed through and recorded when supplied, but OpenMontage still polls tasks by default.
- `kling_tts` requires an explicit `voice_id`; OpenMontage does not guess a default official voice.
- `kling_avatar` and `kling_lip_sync` register under the existing `avatar` capability and coexist with local SadTalker/Wav2Lip tools. Current avatar pipelines must opt into them explicitly; registry discovery alone does not replace local tools.
- Official Kling audio effects and video effects are documented but intentionally not registered as OpenMontage tools yet, because current pipelines do not have a stable sound-effects or video-effects capability slot for them.

---

### ElevenLabs — Voice, Music, Sound Effects

> **Premium voice quality.** Best TTS for narration-heavy videos. Also generates music and sound effects.

**Tools unlocked:** `elevenlabs_tts`, `music_gen`
**Env var:** `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`

#### Setup

1. Go to [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io) and click **Sign up**
2. Go to **Profile** (bottom-left) > **API Keys**, or visit [elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys](https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys)
3. Click **Create API Key**, name it, copy it
4. Add to `.env`: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=xi_your-key-here`

#### Pricing

| Plan | Price | Characters/month | Key features |
|------|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 10,000 | 3 custom voices, API access, attribution required |
| Starter | $5/mo | 30,000 | No attribution |
| Creator | $22/mo | 100,000 | Professional voice cloning |
| Pro | $99/mo | 500,000 | 96kbps audio, usage analytics |
| Scale | $330/mo | 2,000,000 | Priority support |

**Free tier:** 10,000 characters/month (roughly 2-3 minutes of narration). API access included. Music generation and sound effects also available on free tier with limited credits.

---

### Doubao Speech — Mandarin TTS

> **Strong Mandarin narration.** Volcengine Doubao Speech is a good choice for Chinese explainer voiceovers and long-form narration that needs subtitle timing metadata.

**Tools unlocked:** `doubao_tts`
**Env vars:** `DOUBAO_SPEECH_API_KEY`, `DOUBAO_SPEECH_VOICE_TYPE`

#### Setup

1. Open the Volcengine Doubao Speech console and enable Speech Synthesis 2.0.
2. Create a new-console API Key.
3. Choose a Speech 2.0 voice type, for example `zh_female_vv_uranus_bigtts`.
4. Add to `.env`:
   ```bash
   DOUBAO_SPEECH_API_KEY=your-api-key
   DOUBAO_SPEECH_VOICE_TYPE=zh_female_vv_uranus_bigtts
   ```

#### API Notes

OpenMontage uses the new-console API key flow:

```text
X-Api-Key: ${DOUBAO_SPEECH_API_KEY}
X-Api-Resource-Id: seed-tts-2.0
```

Do not pass a new-console API Key as `X-Api-App-Id` or `X-Api-Access-Key`. That mismatch can produce `load grant: requested grant not found`.

#### What It Is Best For

- Natural Mandarin narration for Chinese-language explainers
- Async long-form narration via `/api/v3/tts/submit` and `/api/v3/tts/query`
- Character-level timing metadata for subtitle alignment
- Calm educational pacing where the video duration can follow the approved voice rhythm

#### Pacing

Start with `speech_rate: 0` for natural Mandarin delivery. If the approved format needs a tighter runtime, compare short samples at `speech_rate: 25` or `50` before generating the full narration. Do not force Doubao to match another provider's duration unless the user explicitly wants that tradeoff.

#### Pricing

Doubao Speech 2.0 is billed by character package or usage in Volcengine. OpenMontage estimates cost from text length and prefers provider-returned usage metadata when available.

---

### Azure AI Speech — Speech-to-Text

> **Cloud transcription.** Azure AI Speech Fast Transcription turns local audio into text with word-level timestamps, speaker diarization, and multi-language identification — no GPU required. Optional: the local faster-whisper `transcriber` remains the default offline STT path. When `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY` is set, the agent prefers `azure_stt` for cloud transcription.

**Tools unlocked:** `azure_stt`
**Env vars:** `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY`, `AZURE_SPEECH_REGION` (or `AZURE_SPEECH_ENDPOINT`)

#### Setup

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), create a **Speech** resource (Azure AI services → Speech service).
2. Open the resource's **Keys and Endpoint** page.
3. Copy **KEY 1** and the **Location/Region** (e.g. `eastus`).
4. Add to `.env`:
   ```bash
   AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=your-speech-resource-key
   AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=eastus
   # AZURE_SPEECH_ENDPOINT=https://<custom>...  # optional, overrides region
   ```

#### API Notes

OpenMontage uses the **Fast Transcription** REST endpoint, which accepts a local
audio file directly (multipart upload) and returns a synchronous result — no
Azure Blob storage, SAS URLs, or async job polling:

```text
POST https://{region}.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/speechtotext/transcriptions:transcribe?api-version=2024-11-15
Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: ${AZURE_SPEECH_KEY}
```

For files longer than ~2 hours or bulk jobs, use Azure Batch Transcription instead (not wired into OpenMontage).

#### What It Is Best For

- Cloud transcription with word-level timestamps and no local GPU
- Multi-language auto-detection across a candidate locale set
- Speaker diarization without a HuggingFace token
- Subtitle timing metadata that flows straight into `subtitle_gen`

#### Pricing

Azure AI Speech Standard (S0) bills speech-to-text by audio-hour (roughly
$1.00/audio-hour at time of writing; a free F0 tier includes a limited monthly
allowance). OpenMontage estimates cost from the transcribed audio duration. See
[Azure AI Speech pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/) for current rates.

### Google — TTS + Imagen + Music + Video (Shared Key)

## Local Providers (Free, No API Key)

These providers run entirely on your machine. No network, no API key, no cost. Some require a GPU.

### Remotion — Programmatic Video Composition

> **React-based video rendering.** Turns still images into animated video with spring physics, animated text cards, stat cards, charts, and transitions. **This is the key fallback when no video generation providers are configured** — the agent generates images and Remotion animates them into professional-looking video.

**Tool:** `video_compose` (with `operation="render"` — auto-routes to Remotion when needed)
**Runtime:** CPU (Node.js required)
**Env var:** None

#### Setup

```bash
# Included in make setup, or install manually:
cd remotion-composer && npm install && cd ..
```

Requires **Node.js 18+** and `npx`. The `remotion-composer/` project is included in the repo.

#### What Remotion Renders

| Component | What it produces |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **TextCard** | Animated title/body text with spring physics entrance |
| **StatCard** | Animated statistics with count-up animations |
| **ProgressBar** | Animated progress indicators |
| **CalloutBox** | Highlighted callout panels with icon animations |
| **ComparisonCard** | Side-by-side comparison layouts |
| **BarChart / LineChart / PieChart** | Animated data visualizations |
| **KPIGrid** | Multi-metric dashboard cards |
| **Image scenes** | Still images with spring-animated motion (replaces Ken Burns) |

#### When Does Remotion Activate?

The `video_compose` tool's `render` operation auto-detects when Remotion is needed:
- Cuts contain still images (`.png`, `.jpg`, etc.)
- Cuts have `type` set to `text_card`, `stat_card`, `chart`, etc.
- Cuts specify `animation` or `transition_in`/`transition_out`

If Remotion is not installed, compositions fall back to FFmpeg Ken Burns pan-and-zoom — functional but less engaging.

**Cost:** Free. Always local.

---

### HyperFrames - HTML/CSS/GSAP Video Composition

> **GSAP-native local rendering.** HyperFrames is the preferred runtime for motion-graphics-heavy HTML compositions and the `character-animation` pipeline's rigged SVG character acting.

**Tool:** `hyperframes_compose` directly, or `video_compose` with `edit_decisions.render_runtime="hyperframes"`
**Runtime:** CPU (Node.js >= 22, FFmpeg, and `npx` required)
**Env var:** None

#### Setup

```bash
node --version
ffmpeg -version
npx --yes hyperframes doctor
```

The CLI is consumed as `npx hyperframes`. Do not use `npx @hyperframes/cli`; that package name is not the OpenMontage runtime path.

#### What HyperFrames Renders

| Use case | What it produces |
|----------|------------------|
| **Kinetic typography** | HTML/CSS text animation driven by GSAP timelines |
| **Product / launch videos** | Structured HTML scenes, registry blocks, and transitions |
| **Website-to-video** | Browser-captured site compositions with HyperFrames validation |
| **Character animation** | SVG character rigs, pose/action timelines, and GSAP acting beats rendered to `renders/final.mp4` |

HyperFrames workspaces live under `projects/<project-name>/hyperframes/`. Final videos still follow the normal OpenMontage convention: `projects/<project-name>/renders/final.mp4`.

**Cost:** Free. Always local.

---

### Piper TTS — Offline Text-to-Speech

> **Completely free, fully offline TTS.** No network required. Good quality for drafts and budget-constrained projects.

VIDEO_GEN_LOCAL_MODEL=wan2.1-1.3b      # 6GB+ VRAM (entry-level)
VIDEO_GEN_LOCAL_MODEL=wan2.1-14b       # 24GB+ VRAM (best local quality)
VIDEO_GEN_LOCAL_MODEL=hunyuan-1.5      # 12GB+ VRAM
VIDEO_GEN_LOCAL_MODEL=ltx2-local       # 8GB+ VRAM (fastest)
VIDEO_GEN_LOCAL_MODEL=cogvideo-5b      # 10GB+ VRAM
VIDEO_GEN_LOCAL_MODEL=cogvideo-2b      # 6GB+ VRAM (lightest)
```

#### Model Comparison

| Model | VRAM | Quality | Speed | Best for |
|-------|------|---------|-------|----------|
| **WAN 2.1 (1.3B)** | 6GB | Good | Fast | Entry-level GPU, quick iteration |

## FAQ

**Q: What's the absolute minimum I need to produce a video?**
A: FFmpeg + Node.js (both free, local). FFmpeg handles video assembly, audio mixing, and subtitles. With Node.js, Remotion renders still images into animated video — so even without any video generation API, the agent generates images and Remotion turns them into professional-looking video with spring animations, text cards, and transitions. Add Piper TTS for free narration and Pexels/Pixabay for free stock footage.

**Q: I don't have any video generation providers. Can I still make videos?**
A: Yes. The agent generates still images (via any image provider — even free stock from Pexels/Pixabay) and Remotion composes them into animated video with spring physics transitions, text cards, stat cards, and charts. This is the default path for explainer and animation pipelines when no video gen is configured.

**Q: What's one low-friction way to get AI-generated images and video?**
A: fal.ai (`FAL_KEY`) is one pay-as-you-go option with broad single-key coverage. It unlocks FLUX images plus multiple video providers. No subscription — pay only for what you generate.

**Q: I have a GPU. What can I run locally for free?**
A: Set `VIDEO_GEN_LOCAL_ENABLED=true` and install `diffusers`. You get WAN 2.1, Hunyuan, CogVideo, and LTX video generation plus Stable Diffusion image generation — all free, all offline.

**Q: Which TTS provider should I use?**
A: For quality → ElevenLabs. For localization (50+ languages) → Google TTS. For budget → Google free tier (1M chars/month). For offline → Piper.

**Q: Do I need all these providers?**
A: No. Start with what you have. The selector pattern auto-routes to whatever's available. Missing a provider? The system falls through to the next one automatically.
